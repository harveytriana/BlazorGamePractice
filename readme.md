# A Practice in Blazor WebAssembly
Some time ago I saw a video by Héctor de León on YouTube, about how to make a Pong game scheme, in pure JavaScript, and in a very short time. I saw it again today, and wondered, what would this be like with Blazor, without a single line of JavaScript. Well, the result is this.

I reuse some logic and programmed other things, all Blazor style. It shows the powerful reactive ability of Blazor, and the elegance of the code. It was an interesting exercise.

It is more of a practice rather than a product, where it could evolve a lot; if you want to create branches, you're welcome.

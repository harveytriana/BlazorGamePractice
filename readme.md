You find many sources to do this exercise with pure JavaScript, some supported on `canvas`, others with only CSS. An example [»»](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pong-game-in-javascript/)

Doing it in Blazor is an interesting exercise, the goal here is not a product. I used some of the JavaScript logic, common in sources, and programmed other things for C#. It demonstrates the powerful reactive ability of Blazor, without a line of JavaScript. Try to formalize the code into good practice; It could be done in a single component, but it is not elegant. Didactically it is a good suggestion to see what an architecture would look like for a game written in Blazor.
